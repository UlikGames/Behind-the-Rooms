# GorGood Backrooms
What happens if you give a developer... Unreal Engine 5 and no experience? This, my first game ever made on UE5 with blueprints.

I know other devs did way better than me but I wanted to try for the first time.
Thanks alot to the youtube tutorials and my friends who helped me and gave more ideas!

**Hope you like it! ❣**

## 📋 Minimum requirements to setup the project.

* Unreal Engine 4.27 or better
* A good PC to open the project
* Visual Studio 2022 (optional, only install it if you'd like to build it for Windows)



# 🛠 Setting up the project:

* Download the project | You can download the ZIP or clone it with git, or just use whatever you're familiar with.



* Create a folder wherever you like to place the project.
* Extract the ZIP
* And then simply open up the project



* **Congrats! You can now edit the project and do any modifications you like.**
