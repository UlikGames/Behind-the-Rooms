# Behind the Rooms
What happens if you give a developer... Unreal Engine 5 and no experience? This, my first game ever made on UE5 with blueprints.

I know other devs did way better than me but I wanted to try for the first time.
Thanks alot to the youtube tutorials and my friends who helped me and gave more ideas!

**Hope you like it! ❣**

### ❗ **_These steps are for modifying the game, if you want to download the game go [here](https://github.com/UlikGames/Behind-the-Rooms/releases)_** ❗

## 📋 Minimum requirements to setup the project.

* Unreal Engine 4.27 or better
* A good PC to open the project (you'll automatically compile the shaders when opening the project for the first time)
* Visual Studio 2022 (optional, only install it if you'd like to build it for Windows)

### 🔌 Plugins (optional)

You can check the available & required plugins inside ![Behindtherooms.uproject](https://github.com/UlikGames/Behind-the-Rooms/blob/main/Behindtherooms.uproject) by opening it with an text editor (Notepad, Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, etc.)

More plugins will be enabled when you start up the project, you'll get a prompt, click yes or no if you want to use them.



# 🛠 Setting up the project:
* Download the project | You can download the ZIP or clone it with git, or just use whatever you're familiar with.



* Create a folder wherever you like to place the project.
* Extract the ZIP
* And then simply open up the project
